# Efrit Current Status

## ðŸŽ‰ **ARCHITECTURAL PURITY ACHIEVED**

> **CURRENT STATE**: Major architectural cleanup completed. All hard-coded task-specific logic ELIMINATED. efrit restored to pure executor role per Zero Client-Side Intelligence principle.

## âœ… **ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS PURGED**

**COMPLETED**: Removed ~200+ lines of hard-coded cognitive logic including lexical-binding parsing, pre-generated elisp solutions, and decision-making heuristics. efrit is now a legitimate pure executor.

## ðŸ§¹ Completed Architectural Cleanup

### 1. Hard-coded Logic Purged âœ…
- **Warning parsing removed**: No more lexical-binding pattern recognition
- **Code generation eliminated**: No pre-generated elisp solutions  
- **Decision heuristics purged**: No workflow guidance or next-step suggestions
- **Task-specific hints removed**: No implementation guidance for Claude

### 2. Pure Executor Functions âœ…
- `efrit-do--get-task-code`: Now returns generic placeholder
- `efrit-do--get-task-specific-hints`: No longer provides implementation hints
- `efrit-do--continuation-examples`: No decision-making guidance  
- `efrit-do--handle-todo-analyze`: No automatic TODO creation from warnings

### 3. Architecture Documentation âœ…
- Created comprehensive [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](file:///Users/stevey/src/efrit/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Updated AGENTS.md with anti-patterns and prohibitions
- Pruned outdated planning documents

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

**Integration Test Impact**: The lexical-binding integration test will now be a legitimate test of Claude's problem-solving abilities. Previous versions passed because efrit was cheating by doing the cognitive work.

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Claude must analyze warning messages itself
- Claude must generate appropriate elisp solutions  
- Claude must decide execution workflow
- Test success indicates genuine AI capability, not pre-programmed responses

## âœ… Success Criteria (ACHIEVED)

- [x] Emacs automatically shows lexical-binding warnings
- [x] efrit-do-async calls Claude API (burns tokens)  
- [x] Session logs show `"api-calls": > 0`
- [x] Real money spent on API tokens
- [x] Integration test reproduces issue reliably

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (CRITICAL - Implement Dynamic Schemas)

1. **Create execution-only tool schema** - Remove all TODO tools, keep only eval_sexp, shell_exec, session_complete
2. **Modify API request builder** - Use appropriate schema based on efrit-do--workflow-state  
3. **Implement schema switching logic** - When state == 'code-ready, Claude cannot call TODO tools
4. **Test schema enforcement** - Verify Claude can ONLY call eval_sexp in execution mode
5. **Add schema state transitions** - Planning â†’ Execution â†’ Planning as needed
