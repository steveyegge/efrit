# Efrit Current Status

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: FAKE INTEGRATION TEST**

> **URGENT**: The integration test was **COMPLETELY FAKE** - it tested elisp execution directly without calling Claude. The real issue is efrit-do-async gets stuck in TODO loops and never calls the Anthropic API (0 tokens burned).

## Current Mission: Real Integration Test

**GOAL**: Create a CORRECT token-burning integration test that:

1. **Loads 3 elisp files missing lexical-binding cookies**
2. **Lets Emacs generate warnings in *Warnings* buffer automatically** 
3. **Uses efrit-do-async to direct efrit to fix the warnings**
4. **Has Claude discover warnings and fix files autonomously**  
5. **Actually burns tokens by calling Claude API**

## Key Issues Discovered

### 1. efrit-do-async Never Calls Claude API ❌
- Session logs show `"api-calls":0` despite running for minutes
- Gets stuck in TODO loops: "todo_get_instructions called 14 times in a row - possible loop!"
- Duration: 92+ seconds with no progress

### 2. Previous Test Was Fake ❌ 
- Used `efrit-protocol-execute-tool` directly (offline)
- Pre-wrote the exact elisp code instead of letting Claude discover
- Never tested Claude's autonomous problem-solving
- 0 tokens burned, no real AI workflow

### 3. TODO System Broken ❌
- `todo_get_instructions` causes infinite loops
- Prevents efrit-do-async from reaching Claude API
- Core workflow completely broken

## Files That Need Real Testing

```elisp
;; These files should trigger automatic Emacs warnings
test/integration/broken-file-1.el  ; Missing lexical-binding cookie
test/integration/broken-file-2.el  ; Missing lexical-binding cookie  
test/integration/broken-file-3.el  ; Missing lexical-binding cookie
```

## Required Test Workflow

```elisp
;; 1. Load files (should generate warnings automatically)
;; 2. Call efrit with natural language
(efrit-do-async "Fix the lexical-binding warnings in the *Warnings* buffer")

;; 3. Verify tokens burned and files fixed
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Emacs automatically shows lexical-binding warnings
- [ ] efrit-do-async calls Claude API (burns tokens)  
- [ ] Session logs show `"api-calls": > 0`
- [ ] Claude discovers warnings autonomously
- [ ] All 3 files get lexical-binding headers added
- [ ] Real money spent on API tokens

## Next Steps

1. **Debug TODO loop issue** - Fix infinite `todo_get_instructions` calls
2. **Create correct test** - Generate real Emacs warnings, call efrit-do-async
3. **Verify token burning** - Ensure Claude API is actually called
4. **Test autonomy** - Verify Claude discovers and fixes warnings without pre-written code
