{"id":"ef-05m","title":"Infrastructure: Tool execution timeout and async support","description":"Some new tools can be slow. Need robust timeout and async handling.\n\n## Problem scenarios\n- search_content on huge repo: could take minutes\n- fetch_url on slow server: could hang\n- project_files with deep recursion: could be slow\n\n## Proposed solutions\n\n### 1. Universal timeout\n- efrit-tool-timeout-seconds (default: 30)\n- All tools wrapped in with-timeout\n- Clean error message when timeout hit\n\n### 2. Progress reporting\n- Long-running tools emit progress\n- 'Searching... 1000 files scanned'\n- 'Fetching... 50KB received'\n- Use efrit-progress.el infrastructure\n\n### 3. Async tool execution (advanced)\nSome tools could return immediately with job ID:\n- search_content returns 'job-123'\n- Later tool check_job_status returns results\n- Allows Claude to do other things while waiting\n\n### 4. Cancellation\n- User can cancel long-running tools\n- Clean shutdown, partial results returned\n- 'Search cancelled after 1000 results'\n\n## Implementation notes\n- Leverage existing efrit-executor async infrastructure\n- May need to extend for tool-level async\n- Consider using Emacs' make-process for external tools","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-25T16:40:37.193324-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-25T16:40:37.193324-08:00"}

Nice to meet you!'\n- Function was properly defined (fboundp returns t)\n- But Claude called eval_sexp 6 times with the SAME input\n- Circuit breaker eventually blocked it at call #4\n- Session never completed normally\n\n**Root cause hypothesis:**\n1.

Claude may be trying to 'verify' the result but keeps re-executing instead\n\n**Impact:** \n- Every successful command burns 4-6x more tokens than needed\n- User experience is poor (long waits for simple tasks)\n- Circuit breaker masks the problem but doesn't solve it\n\n**Fix needed:**\nAdd explicit instruction: 'When you execute code and get a successful result, IMMEDIATELY call session_complete with a summary of what you accomplished.
