Instead, it keeps re-calling the same tool with identical input until the circuit breaker trips.\n\n**Evidence:**\nCommand: 'Define a function called efrit-test-greet that takes a name parameter and displays a message greeting that person, then call it with my name Steve'\n\n- eval_sexp executed successfully: 'Hello, Steve! Nice to meet you!'\n- Function was properly defined (fboundp returns t)\n- But Claude called eval_sexp 6 times with the SAME input\n- Circuit breaker eventually blocked it at call #4\n- Session never completed normally\n\n**Root cause hypothesis:**\n1. Claude doesn't recognize when the task is complete\n2. The system prompt SESSION MODE instructions don't clearly say 'call session_complete when your task succeeds'\n3. Claude may be trying to 'verify' the result but keeps re-executing instead\n\n**Impact:** \n- Every successful command burns 4-6x more tokens than needed\n- User experience is poor (long waits for simple tasks)\n- Circuit breaker masks the problem but doesn't solve it\n\n**Fix needed:**\nAdd explicit instruction: 'When you execute code and get a successful result, IMMEDIATELY call session_complete with a summary of what you accomplished. Do NOT re-execute the same code.'","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-24T21:14:03.996904-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-24T21:56:51.14178-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-24T21:56:51.14178-08:00","source_repo":"."}
