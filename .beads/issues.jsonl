Feels like chatting with a colleague\n2. Can see exactly what Efrit is doing at any moment\n3. Can intervene (pause, redirect, input) without friction\n4. No flicker or jank during updates\n5. Comparable to Claude Code's terminal experience\n\n## Out of Scope (for now)\n- Multi-session management (separate epic)\n- Mobile/terminal-only rendering","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-27T00:37:39.167324-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-29T12:43:14.363844-08:00"}
