{"id":"ef-14q","title":"efrit-agent: Not available in autoload list","description":"efrit-agent module exists and loads when dependencies are available, but it's not registered in the autoload list in efrit.el. This means:\n\n1. M-x efrit-agent won't work without (require 'efrit-agent)\n2. The new agent buffer support isn't accessible to users\n3. It's inconsistent with how efrit-chat, efrit-do, etc. are exposed\n\nThe module at lisp/interfaces/efrit-agent.el has a public function efrit-agent but no autoload declaration in efrit.el.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-30T16:50:48.378723-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T16:51:45.604501-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-30T16:51:45.604501-08:00","close_reason":"Added efrit-agent to autoload list in efrit.el, also added to keybindings and help text"}

Call (efrit-send-message \"test message\") directly\nResult: Error - message is nil\nExpected: Message is sent to API\n\nThe issue is that when called non-interactively, the message parameter isn't being bound properly.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-30T16:50:48.358441-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T16:51:29.787493-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-30T16:51:29.787493-08:00","close_reason":"Fixed by making efrit-chat return the buffer it creates and sets up"}
