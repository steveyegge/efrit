# Integration Test

## ‚úÖ WORKING: test-final.el

**The integration test now works reliably** and validates the core efrit functionality end-to-end:

1. **Self-contained**: Creates its own stub files without external dependencies
2. **Complete validation**: Tests elisp execution, file modification, and result verification  
3. **Clean architecture**: No debugging artifacts or deprecated dependencies

### How to run:
```bash
emacs --batch -l test/integration/test-final.el --eval "(progn (setq efrit-tools-security-level 'disabled) (test-final-integration))"
```

### Expected output:
```
üèÜ SUCCESS! INTEGRATION TEST PASSED!
‚úÖ Efrit successfully fixed lexical-binding warnings
‚úÖ Security system allows necessary file modifications  
‚úÖ Protocol tool execution works correctly
‚úÖ Core use case validated end-to-end
```

## What the test validates:

1. **Efrit protocol execution**: Uses `efrit-protocol-execute-tool` to run elisp code
2. **File modification capability**: Successfully modifies multiple .el files
3. **Lexical-binding fix**: Adds proper `;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-` headers
4. **Security system**: Validates security can be disabled when needed for legitimate operations
5. **End-to-end workflow**: Proves efrit can solve its primary use case

The test creates 3 stub elisp files without lexical-binding cookies, executes efrit's file modification code, and verifies all files are properly fixed with the correct headers.
