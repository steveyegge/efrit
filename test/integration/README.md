# Integration Test Status

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: PREVIOUS TEST WAS FAKE**

**The test-final.el was COMPLETELY FAKE** and did not test the real efrit workflow:

❌ **What it actually did:**
- Called `efrit-protocol-execute-tool` directly (offline)
- Pre-wrote the exact elisp code to fix files
- Never called Claude API (0 tokens burned)
- Tested elisp execution, not AI discovery

❌ **What it should do:**
- Load elisp files missing lexical-binding cookies
- Have Emacs generate warnings automatically in *Warnings* buffer
- Call `efrit-do-async` with natural language
- Let Claude discover warnings and fix files autonomously  
- Actually burn API tokens

## Current Mission: Real Integration Test

### Required Test Behavior

1. **Automatic Warning Generation**
   ```elisp
   ;; Load these files - Emacs should automatically show warnings
   test/integration/broken-file-1.el  ; Missing lexical-binding cookie
   test/integration/broken-file-2.el  ; Missing lexical-binding cookie
   test/integration/broken-file-3.el  ; Missing lexical-binding cookie
   ```

2. **Real Claude API Call**
   ```elisp
   ;; This should burn tokens
   (efrit-do-async "Fix the lexical-binding warnings in the *Warnings* buffer")
   ```

3. **Autonomous Discovery**
   - Claude finds warnings in *Warnings* buffer
   - Claude locates problematic files  
   - Claude writes elisp code to fix them
   - Claude executes the fix

### Current Blocker: TODO Loops

**efrit-do-async doesn't work** - it gets stuck in infinite `todo_get_instructions` loops:
- Sessions run for 90+ seconds with 0 API calls
- Warning: "todo_get_instructions called 14 times in a row - possible loop!"
- Never reaches Claude API, burns 0 tokens

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Emacs automatically shows lexical-binding warnings in *Warnings* buffer
- [ ] efrit-do-async calls Claude API and burns tokens
- [ ] Session logs show `"api-calls": > 0`
- [ ] Claude discovers and fixes warnings autonomously
- [ ] All 3 files get proper lexical-binding headers
- [ ] Files left modified (no revert) so we can see when it works

## Next Steps

1. Debug why efrit-do-async gets stuck in TODO loops
2. Create correct test that generates real Emacs warnings
3. Fix TODO system to allow API calls
4. Verify real token burning occurs
