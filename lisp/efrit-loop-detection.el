;;; efrit-loop-detection-fixed.el --- Progress-based loop detection for Efrit -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2024 Efrit Contributors

;; This file is part of Efrit.

;;; Commentary:

;; This module implements progress-based loop detection as recommended by the Oracle.
;; Instead of counting tool names, it tracks actual state changes and work completion.

;;; Code:
